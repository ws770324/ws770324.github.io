## Welcome!!

I build this page to share the projects I made during my master study.Feel free to browse my works and give me some feedback :)


### [Predicting the Odds of Winning a Match on tennis](https://github.com/ws770324/logist_AUO2017) 
The data was the record of all players who attend the Australia Open in 2017. I used PCA and model selectino to extract data from the first round and built a logistic model to predict the the winners of the second round. 

### [Comparing the Probability of Credit Card Approval between AIC-based Model Selection and Ridge Penalty](https://github.com/ws770324/creditcard_ridge)
This project is focusing on comparing regulation methods. I first fitted a logistic regresiion model, used ROC curve to find out the best cutoff point, and comparing the accuracy using cross-validation algorithm. For security issue, I replace the variables by charatchters. 

### [Analysis and Prediction of the Tendency of Stock](https://github.com/ws770324/logist_stock)
Years ago I invested stocks market using the strategies I learned from books and some instructors but unfortunately these strategies did not help me to reach my goal. Therefore, I choose the stock data from 2015 to 2019 and used hierarchical clustering, PCA, and logistic regression to contruct a predictive model to examine these strategies.

### Classification and Missing-data imputation by Machine Learning Methods

### [Comparing Sampling Survey Methods Using HIV Follow-up Data](https://github.com/ws770324/surveytech_HIV)
Different to previous projects, this project focus on sampling techniques. I simulated sampling results using HIV follow-up data to compare the variation and the accuracy on different sampling methods.

### Classification of Vowel Sound

### [Explore venues around Toronto](https://github.com/ws770324/scraping)
It's a very interesting project! I scaped postcode in Toronto from Wikipedia and used Foursquare API to access venues around each area, and finally visualized the result using folium.
