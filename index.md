## Welcome!!

I build this page to share the projects I made during my master study.Feel free to browse my works and give me some feedback :)

### Titanic prediction challenge

This might be the first projects for many people. It's exciting when we are more close to how they made the decision but it's sad to know they have to make that decision. I used data visualization methods and EDA to approach the decision theory and built a decision tree based on the information.

### [Atlanta food 101](https://github.com/ws770324/capstone)

Nice food is so important for graduate students. No one can reject hot beef fried Rice and a cup of ice boba milk tea after a whole day work. In this project, I will find out the best place to live for graduate students in Atlanta using Foursquare API and clustering methods.

### [Explore venues around Toronto](https://github.com/ws770324/scraping)
It's a very interesting project! I scaped postcode in Toronto from Wikipedia and used Foursquare API to access venues around each area, and finally visualized the result using folium.

### [Comparing Sampling Survey Methods Using HIV Follow-up Data](https://github.com/ws770324/surveytech_HIV)
Different to previous projects, this project focus on sampling techniques. I simulated sampling results using HIV follow-up data to compare the variation and the accuracy on different sampling methods.

### Classification of Vowel Sound

### [Analysis and Prediction of the Tendency of Stock](https://github.com/ws770324/logist_stock)
Years ago I invested stocks market using the strategies I learned from books and some instructors but unfortunately these strategies did not help me to reach my goal. Therefore, I choose the stock data from 2015 to 2019 and used hierarchical clustering, PCA, and logistic regression to contruct a predictive model to examine these strategies.

### Classification and Missing-data imputation by Machine Learning Methods
This project has two main objects: classification and missing value imputing.

### [Comparing the Probability of Credit Card Approval between AIC-based Model Selection and Ridge Penalty](https://github.com/ws770324/creditcard_ridge)

This project is focusing on comparing regulation methods. I first fitted a logistic regresiion model, used ROC curve to find out the best cutoff point, and comparing the accuracy using cross-validation algorithm. For security issue, I replace the variables by charatchters.

### [Predicting the Odds of Winning a Match on tennis](https://github.com/ws770324/logist_AUO2017) 

The data was the record of all players who attend the Australia Open in 2017. I used PCA and model selectino to extract data from the first round and built a logistic model to predict the the winners of the second round.
